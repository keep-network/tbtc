== Background

Why do we want to do the thing this RFC describes?

=== Current Functionality

 - If applicable, what is the existing functionality related to this feature?
 - In particular if this is an enhancement to existing functionality, lay out
   some context for how the existing functionality falls short.

== Proposal

Quick summary of the goal and outline of the proposal.

=== Goal

The goal of this proposal. What are we trying to achieve? Examples of desired
outcomes would be handy.

=== Implementation

How will we achieve it? Examples of how the implementation will be used could be
useful. Flow diagrams can also be useful here. If an RFC is meant to define
requirements rather than implementation, this section can be left for a future
RFC.

=== Limitations

What are the limitations of this approach?

=== Proof of Concept

If you have PoC code, refer to the relevant branch and give a brief summary.

== Future Work (optional)

If applicable, what future evolutions could you see this approach leading to?
Particularly if these possibilities influenced your thinking about the main
proposal, this is important.

== Open Questions (optional)

If any open questions are left that you haven't yet investigated, what are they?

- If you have publications, you can include them in bibliography style. If you
  start your bullet with an id in _triple_ square brackets (e.g. `+[[[AAKE]]]+`),
  you can reference it in the content body using regular cross-reference syntax
  (e.g. `+<<AAKE>>+`).
