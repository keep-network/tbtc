= Funding Flow

ifndef::tbtc[toc::[]]


== Overview

This is the process to set up a deposit, and fund it with BTC. Upon successful
funding, the funder will own and new _Deposit_ and will be able to create new
TBTC. To start the funding process, a funder places a small bond, and requests
creation of a new keep to custody BTC. If a new keep is successfully formed,
the Keep contracts notify the _Deposit_ of the signing group's public key. If
keep setup fails, the funding process is aborted and the Keep system punishes
the faulting parties.

Once a keep is formed, the funder transfers BTC to the keep's pay to witness
public key hash (p2wpkh) address. This BTC becomes the underlying collateral
for the new _Deposit_. The funder proves deposit via a stateless SPV proof of
inclusion in the Bitcoin blockchain. If the funder fails to make this transfer
in a timely manner, the funding process is aborted and the funder's keep bond
is forfeit.

Once BTC collateralization has been proven, the _Deposit_ becomes active. Then
the funder may withdraw TBTC, up to the amount of BTC collateral (less the
reserved TBTC). The funding process can only result in an active _Deposit_ or
an abort state.

== States

=== `START`
* Deposit does not exist yet

=== `AWAITING_SIGNER_SETUP`
* The funder has placed a bond, and requested a signing group
* The Keep contracts must select a signing group or return failure

=== `AWAITING_BTC_FUNDING_PROOF`
* A signing group has been formed, and their public key hash returned
* The funder MUST return a SPV proof of funding before a timeout

=== `FRAUD_AWAITING_BTC_FUNDING_PROOF`
* Signing group fraud has been detected before the funding proof has been
  provided
* Signers bonds are seized when this state is entered.
* If the funder can provide a funding proof in a reasonable amount of time,
  then they will receive the singer bonds
* If the timeout elapses, signer bonds will be partially slashed and then
  returned.
* NOTE: the timeout on this state should be relatively short. We want to make
  it risky for a depositor who _has not already funded_ when this state is
  entered to fund in order after this state is entered in order to try to
  receive the full signer bond amount

=== Reachable exterior states
* `FAILED_SETUP`
** via a timeout in `AWAITING_SIGNER_SETUP`
** via a timeout in `AWAITING_BTC_FUNDING_PROOF`
** via any state transitin from `FRAUD_AWAITING_BTC_FUNDING_PROOF`
* `ACTIVE`
** via `provideBTCFundingProof`

  group setup has failed (or at least not proceeded in a timely manner)

=== `notifyFundingTimeout`
* Anyone may notify a Deposit that its funder has failed to submit a funding
  proof. The funder's bond is forfeit due to non-completion at this point

=== `provideFundingECDSAFraudProof`
* Provide a fraud proof before a funding SPV proof has been verified
* The funder's bond is returned here
* Signer bonds are seized here
* We consider this to be a different transition than `provideECDSAFraudProof`
  because it yields a different state. This also prevents edge cases with very
  short-lived deposits
* *access control*
** anyone
* *args*
** `bytes _signature`
*** The purportedly fraudulent signature
** `bytes _publicKey`
*** The public key to verify the signature under (must match signer account)
** `bytes _digest`
*** The digest on which the signature was made
** `bytes _preImage`
*** The sha256 preimage of that digest (on Bitcoin txns, this will always be
    the 32 byte intermediate sighash digest)
** `address signersThresholdKeyAccount`
*** to check that the signature is valid
* *from*
** `AWAITING_BTC_FUNDING_PROOF`
* *to*
** `FRAUD_AWAITING_BTC_FUNDING_PROOF`

=== `notifyFraudFundingTimeout`
* Anyone may notify a Deposit that its funder has failed to submit a funding
  proof during the fraud period. The funder is not penalized for this
* When this occurs, signer bonds are partially slashed and then returned
* We consider this to be a different transition than `notifyFundingTimeout`
  because it yields a different state and has different behavior
* *access control*
** anyone
* *from*
** `FRAUD_AWAITING_BTC_FUNDING_PROOF`
* *to*
** `FAILED_SETUP`

=== `provideFraudBTCFundingProof`
* Anyone may notify a Deposit that its funder has sent funds to the signers'
  Bitcoin public key hash
* If this occurs, signer bonds are distributed to the funder
* We consider this to be a different transition than `provideBTCFundingProof`
  because it yields a different state and has different behavior
* *access control*

== External Transitions

=== `provideBTCFundingProof`

  The funder's bond is returned once this proof is successfully verified
