= tbtc Contribution Guide

ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ Contributions are welcome from
anyone on the internet, and even the smallest of fixes are appreciated!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to tBTC and its packages.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

== Getting started

1.  Fork https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc[`keep-network/tbtc`]
2.  Clone your fork
3.  Follow the link:README.adoc#installation[installation & build steps] in the
    repo's top-level README.
4.  Setup the recommended <<Development Tooling>>.
5.  Open a PR against the `main` branch and describe the change you are
    intending to undertake in the PR description.

Before marking the PR as open for review, make sure:

* It passes the linter checks; see <<Pre-commit>> to make this automatic
* It passes the https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc/actions[continuous
  integration tests].
* Your changes have sufficient test coverage (e.g regression tests have been
  added for bug fixes, unit tests for new features)

== Development Tooling

Commits
https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-commit-signature-verification[must
be signed].

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc/actions[Github Actions] for
continuous integration. All jobs (including tests, linting) must be green to
merge a PR.

=== Pre-commit

Pre-commit is a tool to install hooks that check code before commits are made.
It can be helpful to install this, to automatically run linter checks. Follow
the https://pre-commit.com/[installation instructions], and then run `pre-commit
install` to install the hooks.

=== Linting

Linters for Solidity and JavaScript code are setup and run automatically as part
of pre-commit hooks.

If you want to change a rule, or add a custom rule, please propose these changes
to our https://github.com/keep-network/solium-config-keep[solium-config-keep]
and https://github.com/keep-network/eslint-config-keep[eslint-config-keep]
packages. All other packages have it as a dependency.
