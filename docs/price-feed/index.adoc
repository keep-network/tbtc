= Price Feed

ifndef::tbtc[toc::[]]

The price feed is an integral part of the system, ensuring sufficient
collateral backs all tBTC signers. For tBTC v1, the feed will be built on a
https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/oracle-module/oracle-security-module-osm-detailed-documentation[ETHBTC Oracle Security Module]
from MakerDAO, currently operated by MakerDAO.

The minimal price feed design is specified completely by the interface below:

[source,solidity]
----
interface PriceFeed {
    function getPrice() external view returns (uint128);
    function updatePrice(uint128 price) public;
}
----

It is principally used for calculating the value of Bitcoin lot deposits, priced in Ether.

== Price encoding

A bitcoin has 8 decimal places, the smallest unit being a satoshi, meaning 100 000 000 satoshis = 1 bitcoin.
An ether by contrast, has 18 decimal places, the smallest unit being a wei, meaning
1 000 000 000 000 000 000 wei = 1 ether.

To express the price of bitcoin relative to ether, we must use a ratio of the number of wei to a satoshi.
A simple design is to use `x` wei : 1 satoshi. Hence, for a call to `getPrice` when 32.32 ETH : 1 BTC (Jun 2019),
the value 323 200 000 000 wei is returned.

However, if 1 wei is worth more than 1 sat, then the price can no longer be accurately encoded. This scenario of a 'flippening',
when 1 ether becomes worth 10,000,000,000x as much as 1 bitcoin, we find unlikely in the very short-term.
Rather than prematurely optimize, incorporating a 2 integer ratio of `x` wei to `y` satoshi and changing the call semantics,
we leave this as a future exercise for governance.

== Future design

The price feed is integral to tBTC's security and in the future, will be
principally governed by the tBTC ecosystem. The first upgrades will focus on
incorporating a novel price feed mechanism based on reverse auction challenges
that has been dubbed the "priceless feed".
