== Visão geral

== Convenções

As palavras-chave tais como "DEVEM", "NÃO DEVEM", "NECESSÁRIO",  "RECOMENDADO", "PODE", "NÃO PODE" e "OPCIONAL" neste documento são para ser interpretado como descrito em https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

== Uma observação sobre a nomeação

O sistema, na sua totalidade, é chamado "tBTC". Neste documento e em todo o projeto, o token fungível suportado por Bitcoin é chamado "TBTC" para distinguir do resto do projeto e sugerir fortemente um eventual ticker.

Discussões adicionais podem ser encontradas em 
https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc/issues/17[Github].

== Trabalho prévio

Os esforços anteriores em direção a um bitcoin multi-blockchain (cross-chain) são bem conhecidos. Uma pegada de Bitcoin é desejável para sidechains - para extensões de funcionalidade e escalabilidade para a conservadoramente atualizada blockchain principal do Bitcoin. Devido ao interesse precoce em sidechains, existem várias abordagens de Bitcoin peg, anteriores ao Ethereum.

=== Centralizado, Provável, Resgatável

Two solutions in the wild today provide centralized pegs that rely on trusted
third parties based on variants of the "federated peg" model.

In a federated peg, a multi-sig wallet is used to lock up bitcoins. Another
blockchain then issues tokens representing those bitcoin. The signers of the
multisig on the Bitcoin chain are expected to validate the sidechain, and only
allow issued tokes to be burned in exchange for bitcoin withdrawals following
the rules of the sidechain.

https://blockstream.com/liquid/[Liquid], a sidechain developed by
https://blockstream.com/[Blockstream], is an inter-exchange settlement network
based on a federated peg sidechain. Bitcoin is locked in a 15-signer multi-sig
wallet comprised of exchanges and Liquid participants pre-vetted by Blockstream.
These signers validate the sidechain in an approach the team calls "strong
federation", where a majority vote to sign blocks, and agree to approve exits
to the main chain.

https://wbtc.network[WBTC] is a Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token using a similar
approach. The token is part of a greater effort called "Wrapped Tokens".

[quote, the Wrapped Tokens whitepaper]
____
Wrapped tokens follow the centralized model, but instead of relying entirely on
one institution, they rely on a consortium of institutions performing different
roles in the network.
____

The WBTC consortium votes on adding and removing custodians that manage the
token's Bitcoin reserves. Each custodian operates a multi-sig Bitcoin wallet,
with control of all keys. Custodians are able to move custodied bitcoin at
will, and are responsible for minting WBTC on Ethereum.

Together, the custodians act similarly to a traditional federated peg. Instead
of requiring a majority to sign Bitcoin withdrawals, however, a single member
can withdraw their share of the Bitcoin reserves at any time.

==== Trade-offs

These approaches have a few clear benefits

* They each effectively peg Bitcoin on other blockchains.
* Backing reserves are easily audited on-chain at any time.
* Both are simple mechanisms, lowering the chance of operational failure as
well as the total cost to operate.

However, there are downsides. The most obvious is introducing a trust model
incompatible with Bitcoin.

Custodians need to be fully trusted, either as a group, as in Liquid's model,
or individually, following the Wrapped Tokens model. A malicious custodian can
block withdrawals and in some cases collude to abscond with funds. Custodians
may also be compelled by governments, hackers, or other forces to tamper with
reserves, despite their good intentions.

=== Decentralized, Synthetic, Irredeemable

An alternative approach to a centralized peg is to create a decentralized
synthetic asset.

One approach that's been popular on Ethereum is
https://makerdao.com/whitepaper/[Maker's] Dai stablecoin.

Dai is a token synthetically pegged to the US dollar. Ether is locked up in
reserves, which, coupled with a robust price feed and a number of stability
mechanisms, allow for maintenance of the peg under adverse conditions.

While Maker hasn't launched a Bitcoin synthetic, the same network maintaining
Dai's peg could easily be applied to maintain a similar Bitcoin product.

==== Trade-offs

The biggest benefit of a synthetic Bitcoin peg is its flexibility. A synthetic
doesn't need to follow the rules governing the pegged asset, for better or
worse.

For example, a synthetic might effectively "inflate" the supply of the
underlying asset, which might be desirable for some financial systems- and
directly fly in the face of the purpose of a currency aspiring to be hard money.

Despite the potential reuse of Maker's network, launching such a synthetic has
other risks. A synthetic peg to a volatile asset like Bitcoin, backed by a
volatile, under-diversified reserve entirely of Ether, is a dangerous
combination.

== Design Goals

The goal of tBTC is the creation an ERC-20 token that maintains the most
important property of Bitcoin- its status as "hard money".

To maintain the "hard money" status of its backing BTC deposits, tBTC must
remain

* Censorship and seizure resistant, across friendly and unfriendly
jurisdictions
* Inflation-resistant. TBTC may only be minted after proof is provided of a
backing BTC deposit.
* Leverage-resistant. The existence of tBTC shouldn't allow cross-chain
"printing" of additional synthetic Bitcoin. We can't stop someone from launching
a synthetic, but artificially expanding the Bitcoin supply is not a goal of the
project.
* Without middlemen, in the same sense as Bitcoin. The only rent extraction
should be from the minimal participation of signers required to secure the
network, similar to miners on the Bitcoin network.
* Redeemable. The ability to trade scrip for its backing deposit freely is what
distinguishes a backed currency from fiat money. The supply of tBTC is always
backed by an equal number of reserved BTC. This means for every token in
circulation, 1 BTC has been removed from circulation.

Together, these properties ensure a strong supply peg across chains, and the
closest to "hard money" status that a Bitcoin-pegged asset can achieve.

Notably, these properties don't require an artificial price peg as is common
in stable coin projects -- they instead require a supply peg across chains.

== Developing Intuition: A simple single-signer protocol

To understand how we might develop a protocol and token that satisfies those
requirements, it's useful to consider a simple, under-specified variant that
could theoretically do the job.

Imagine an off-chain actor, which we'll call `Signer`; an Ethereum smart
contract that implements the ERC-20 interface, `PeggedBitcoin`; with ticker
`PBTC`, and another contract with the permission to mint and burn
`PBTC` called `PeggedBitcoinReserve`.

Another off-chain actor, `Depositor`, wants to mint a token on the
`PeggedBitcoin` contract. `Depositor` requests the `PeggedBitcoinReserve`
accept a 1 BTC deposit. `PeggedBitcoinReserve` waits for `Signer` to
acknowledge and return a new BTC address, as well as depositing 150% collateral
of the deposit's value in ETH into the `PeggedBitcoinReserve`. `Depositor`
deposits 1 BTC into the new BTC address, and provides proof to
`PeggedBitcoinReserve` - which in turn mints 1 `PBTC`, sending 0.99 to
`Depositor` and .01 to `Signer` for the convenience.

Withdrawals happen in reverse- any participant can send 1 `PBTC` to
`PeggedBitcoinReserve` with a Bitcoin address. `Signer` pays that Bitcoin
address 1 BTC minus any Bitcoin transaction fees, and provides proof of
payment to `PeggedBitcoinReserve`, which burns the remaining 1 `PBTC`,
maintaining a 1:1 backing of `PBTC`. `Signer` is now free to withdraw the
corresponding collateral from `PeggedBitcoinReserve`.

===  Flaws

While this simple design is attractive, it's skipped over some of the more
difficult issues—efficient Bitcoin proof of payment validation on the EVM and
a reliable price feed implementation, for example.

It's also based on a deeply insecure custody solution.

First, the protocol relies on a single signer. If the value of deposits ever
exceeds the value of the collateral `Signer` has put down, there's nothing
stopping `Signer` from walking with the BTC. `Signer` can also decide or be
coerced to censor particular withdrawals, removing any hope of censorship or
seizure resistance.

Second, the protocol relies on a single *hot wallet*. As the market cap of
`PBTC` conceivably grows, the risk due to hacking that wallet increases
tremendously.

Finally, the protocol does nothing to localize failure. If there's an issue
with a single deposit or withdrawal, it could impact the entire `PeggedBitcoin`
supply, blocking all further deposits and withdrawals.

== System Architecture: Designing a robust multi-wallet multi-signer protocol

The rest of this document is devoted to specifying a protocol that addresses
those flaws, providing a robust BTC-backed bearer asset on Ethereum.

At a high level, that means the protocol described must

* have a multi-wallet architecture
* with many geographically distributed signers
* that removes single points of failure

This protocol must also counter the secondary effects of these requirements
and the details we skipped in the single signer example, including multi-signer
payment, a more complex bonding system, an approach for detecting and dealing
with undercollateralized signers, a Bitcoin proof system, and robust handling
of failures on both chains.

Some components necessary to this protocol are described outside this document
and will be assumed. In particular, we assume the existence of

* a well-distributed work token for signer selection
* a random beacon for signer selection
* an efficient distributed key generation protocol on the secp256k1 curve
* an efficient multi-party threshold ECDSA protocol on the secp256k1 curve

all of which are implemented by the https://keep.network[Keep network]. The
importance of these is described in the following sections.

The architecture is broken down into:

* Deposits and signer selection
* Bonding and price feeds
* Minting
* Signer fees
* Signing
* Wallet failure
* Redemption
