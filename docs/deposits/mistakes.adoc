= Mistakes making a deposit

The system is designed to function with a predefined lot size for all _Deposits_
which is given as a system parameter. **Depositors should send the exact lot
amount of BTC in the funding transaction, or expect loss of funds.**
Since it is not possible for the system to force users into sending any specific
amount, ideally the the system would gracefully handle overpayment and
underpayment. The primary impact of overpayment and underpayment is on the
``Deposit``'s collateralization ratio. We treat overpayment and underpayment
as faulty depositor behavior, and pass on the associated costs to the
depositor.

== Underpayment

Allowing underpayment on `Deposit` would result in over-bonded signers. To
prevent this, the system will not accept funding proofs of less than the lot
size (`1.0 BTC` initially). This implies that the a user that sends less than `1.0
BTC` in the funding transaction does not receive any TBTC, and forfeits the BTC
locked in the funding transactions to the Signers. The Signers can unlock and
evenly split the funds in the transaction after the _Deposit_ is resolved on-chain (see
<<Multiple UTXOs>> for a full discussion).

== Overpayment

Overpayment, in contrast, would result in under-bonded signers. When overfunding
occurs, the system accepts the funding proof, but mints TBTC according to the
regular lot size.

In an efficient market, this _Deposit_ will be immediately redeemed,
as the redeemer expects to take the overfunded amount as arbitrage.

Example: A user providing a funding proof for `1.6 BTC` in a system
with lot size of `1 BTC` mints only `1.0 TBTC`. Any user that burns `1.0 TBTC`
is able to claim the `1.6 BTC` _Deposit_.

A depositor should notice this and immediately try to burn their TBTC to reclaim
the amount. If not, the depositor effectively forfeits the overfunded value to
other participants.

== Multiple UTXOs

A faulty depositor may send multiple UTXOs to the signer group address. This
may be the result of human or software error. Unfortunately, returning the
funds to the depositor would impose significant on-chain complexity and gas
fees. Each UTXO would need to be proven via SPV and a signature on it
explicitly authorized. In addition, we would have to develop mechanisms to
economically compel signers to sign each transaction despite the fact that the
total value of the UTXOs is not known. As such, the system accepts only the
first UTXO greater than the deposit lot size. All other BTC sent to the signing
group is forfeit. Therefore it is imperative that depositors send only a single
UTXO of an appropriate size.

As a particularly damaging example, consider a naive human depositor. If she
mistakenly sends half the lot size in one transaction and half in another, both
UTXOs would be forfeit. **This represents a serious pitfall for depositors that
must be carefully addressed by the user interface since significant loss of
funds can occur.**
