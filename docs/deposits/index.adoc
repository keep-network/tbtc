== Overview

tBTC provides a mechanism for creating a token, TBTC, on a non-Bitcoin _host
chain_, that is 1-to-1 backed by bitcoin. Parties interested in minting TBTC
<<Deposit Request,request>> that the tBTC system provide them with a Bitcoin
wallet address. The system selects a set of _signers_, which are tasked with
generating a private/public keypair and furnishing it to the system. The
interested party then becomes a _depositor_ by sending bitcoin to the wallet
(the amount of required bitcoin is discussed separately in the section on
<<Lots,lots>>). The bitcoin that is sent to the wallet is in two parts: one is
eligible for 1-to-1 minting into TBTC, while the other is reserved as incentive
and collateral for the wallet signers.

Each of these steps is shown in the diagram below and discussed in subsequent
sections.

== Deposit request

The starting point for acquiring TBTC is generating a _deposit request_. This is
a transaction to a smart contract on tBTC's host chain that informs the tBTC
system that the sender account is interested in creating a tBTC deposit. The
transaction is a signal that the sender is interested in a signing group to back
a wallet that will receive bitcoin from a wallet the sender controls, in order
to produce TBTC. Because signing groups are not free to create, deposit requests
include a small bond in the host chain's native token to cover the creation of
the signing group. The bond is refunded when a successful deposit is made to the
generated wallet.

=== Signer selection

Once the deposit request is received, the signing group is created by randomly
selecting a set of _signers_ to back a Bitcoin wallet. This is a multi-part
process described in the diagram below.footnote:[The tBTC system participates
in fairly limited fashion here, mostly coordinating work done in a secondary
system responsible for managing the secure random number generation, private
data storage, and multiparty computation needed to provide the system's relevant
security properties. In this diagram, that role is fulfilled by the Keep
network, described in http://keep.network/whitepaper[its whitepaper]. The Keep
Random Beacon is described in more detail in the
http://docs.keep.network/random-beacon/[Keep Random Beacon yellowpaper].]

When a request comes in to create a signing group, the tBTC system requests a
random seed from a secure decentralized random beacon.footnote:[A system is only
as decentralized as its most centralized component, so the beacon must be
decentralized to achieve proper decentralization of the tBTC system as a whole.]
The resulting random seed is used to randomly select signing group members from
the eligible pool of signers. Finally, these signers coordinate a distributed
key generation protocol that results in a public ECDSA key for the group, which
is used to produce a wallet address that is then published to the host chain.
This completes the signer selection phase.

==== Bonding

Before the selected members of a signing group can perform distributed key
generation, they must agree to become members of the signing group by putting up
a bond in the native token of the host chain. This bond is used to penalize the
members of the signing group if an unauthorized piece of data is signed by the
signing group once distributed key generation is complete; it is also used to
penalize a given member if the distributed key generation fails due to an
attributed misbehavior of that member.

Bonding is described in more detail in
<<{root-prefix}bonding/index#bonding,its own section>>.

==== Distributed key generation

Some small notes about the distributed key generation a signing group undergoes.
The distributed key generation protocol should result in three properties:

1. The signing group as a whole should have an _ECDSA public key_, which will be
   shared on the host chain and will correspond to the Bitcoin wallet
   owned by that signing group.
2. Each member of the signing group should have a _threshold ECDSA secret key
   share_, which can be used to create a _threshold ECDSA signature share_ for
   any transactions involving the signing group's wallet.
3. Each member of the signing group should be able to combine a threshold number
   of signature shares from itself and other members of the group to produce a
   signed version of a given transaction to be performed on behalf of the
   signing group.

=== Proof of deposit

Once the tBTC system has a wallet address available for a given deposit request,
the _depositor_ can issue a Bitcoin transaction sending BTC from a wallet they
control to the wallet address for the signing group. Once the transaction has
been sufficiently confirmed by the Bitcoin chain, the depositor has to issue a
transaction to the host chain proving that the _Deposit_ has been funded.

The only link between the Bitcoin chain and the host chain is the tBTC system,
which runs as a set of smart contracts on the host chain. As such, the Bitcoin
transaction issued by the depositor has to be proven to the tBTC system before
the tBTC system allows the depositor to behave as if they have successfully
deposited their BTC into the custodial wallet. When a deposit proof is accepted
by the system, the deposit bond is refunded to the depositor. If a deposit
proof is not received within a given timeout window, the signing group will
disband and the system will seize the bond's value, making it available to the
signing group members to reclaim.

To prove deposit, the depositor constructs a transaction for the host chain
that provides proof that the transaction was accepted on the Bitcoin chain
and has had sufficient work built on top of the block that included the deposit
transaction. These proofs are verified by an on-chain simple payment
verification (SPV) system. A more complete discussion of cross-chain SPV
systems and their security properties is included in the appendix.

// TODO What is "sufficient"? Defined as a system property? Dynamic?

==== Overpayment & Underpayment

To maintain a standard lot size for all _Deposits_ we require the depositor to
send a precise amount of BTC in the funding transaction. Because we can't
enforce this behavior on the Bitcoin chain, the system must account for
overpayment and underpayment. The primary impact of overpayment and
underpayment is on the _Deposit's_ collateralization ratio. The system requires
a minimum collateralization ratio from signers, while the signers desire a
predictable payment for their services. If the depositor sends too much or too
little BTC, the signer incentives are at odds with the system's interests. As
the main goal of the system is to align signer incentives, we treat overpayment
and underpayment as faulty depositor behavior, and pass on the associated costs
to the depositor.

Allowing underpayment on _Deposit_ would result in over-bonded signers. To
prevent this, the system will not accept funding proofs of less than the lot
size. This implies that the BTC is forfeit to the signers, although they cannot
access it until after the _Deposit_ is resolved on-chain (see
<<Multiple UTXOs>> for a full discussion).

Overpayment, in contrast, would result in under-bonded signers. Because theft
of the BTC may be worth more than the signers' bonds, the signers may have an
incentive to collude to steal the BTC. When overfunding occurs, the system
accepts the funding proof, but mints TBTC according to the regular lot size,
and allows redemption of the _Deposit_ by anyone willing to burn a normal lot's
amount of TBTC.

In an efficient market, this _Deposit_ will be immediately redeemed,
as the redeemer expects to take the overfunded amount as arbitrage. The signers
now have a choice: behave honestly, and receive the signer fee immediately, or
collude to steal the deposit. Should they behave honestly, the redeemer's
arbitrage succeeds, and the signers are paid. Should they collude, the
redeemer may prove ECDSA fraud, and take their bonds. Either way, the TBTC
supply peg is preserved. However, unless the depositor is able to redeem
immediately, she essentially forfeits the overfunded value to other
participants.

==== Multiple UTXOs

A faulty depositor may send multiple UTXOs to the signer group address. This
may be the result of human or software error. Unfortunately, returning the
funds to the depositor would impose require significant on-chain complexity and
gas fees, as each UTXO would need to be proven via SPV, and a signature on it
explicitly authorized. In addition, we would have to develop mechanisms to
economically compel signers to sign each transaction despite the fact that the
total value of the UTXOs is not known. As such, the system accepts only the
first UTXO greater than the deposit lot size. All other BTC sent to the signing
group is forfeit. Therefore it is imperative that depositors send only a single
UTXO of an appropriate size.

As a particularly damaging example, consider a naive human depositor. If she
mistakenly sends half the lot size in one transaction and half in another, both
UTXOs would be forfeit. This represents a serious pitfall for depositors that
must be carefully addressed by the user interface.

The signers, while they may collude to move the BTC to other UTXOs, may not do
so during the life of the _Deposit_ contract as the production of the required
signature would constitute ECDSA fraud. As such, the most likely outcome is
that the signers collectively wait to take personal possession of that BTC
until the _Deposit_ concludes naturally. This allows the signers to make
regular signing fees and keep the additional UTXOs without penalty.


=== Light Relays

// TODO: crosslink to appendix SPV section

Light relays are a new variant of on-chain SPV developed for tBTC. They seek to
take advantage of the compact and efficient stateless SPV proofs while relaying
enough information to provide each stateless proof with some recency guarantee.
We achieve this by taking advantage of the difficulty adjustment feature of
Bitcoin's protocol. Bitcoin adjusts difficulty every 2016 blocks, based on
timestamps of the first and last block in that period (due to an off-by-one
error in the Satoshi client, one interblock period is exlcuded from the
difficulty calculation). The change is deterministic and within some tolerance
may be set by the miner of the last block.

A light relay does not store every block header. Instead it stores only a slice
of headers around the difficulty adjustment event and records the difficulty
for the current 2016-block epoch. This slice is validated by its objective
proof of work, as well as verifying that its first headers' difficulty matches
the current epoch difficulty, that the change occurs at an expected index in
the slice, and that the new difficulty conforms to Bitcoin's adjustment
algorithm. In other words, our light relay tracks only Bitcoin's current
difficulty, and no other information about its state.

Knowing the current difficulty gives stateless SPV proofs stronger recency
assurances. Any newly-generated stateless SPV must include that difficulty in
its header chain. And that difficulty is not known to any party in advance.
Miners with an `n`-fraction (as usual, `n >= 2` due to the 51% assumption) of
the hashrate have a `1/n` chance of being allowed to set the difficulty, and
thus have a `1/n` chance of being able to successfully predict it 2 weeks in
advance (by generating fake proofs, and then setting the difficulty such that
they appear valid). Generalized, this is a `1/n^t^` chance of successfully
predicting difficulty `t` adjustment periods (`2t` weeks) in advance. Therefore
the use of the light relay provides stronger security properties to stateless
SPV proofs when used as an additional validation step, as even entities with
significant mining resources have a greatly reduced chance of creating fake
proofs.

== Lots

:lot-size: 1.0

Deposits will be managed in fixed-size _lots_. Each deposit therefore will
have to be of the same amount: {lot-size} BTC. Thus, a depositor submitting
their <<Proof of deposit,proof of deposit>> must prove that they deposited
{lot-size} into the deposit's signing group wallet. If a depositor wants to
deposit more than the lot size, they will need to create multiple deposit
requests and fund multiple deposits. This allows each deposit to be backed by
a different signing group, both simplifying the bonding of signing groups and
improving the resilience of the system to signing group failure.

// TODO Set a proper initial lot size.


== Deposit Economics

:signer-fee-withheld: 0.005 TBTC

Once a deposit has been made and funded, the corresponding TBTC are minted.
Minted TBTC are immediately issued to the funder, who is now the beneficiary of
a funded _Deposit_. To prevent denial of service attacks {signer-fee-withheld}
is withheld on mintng. This will be returned to the beneficiary when the
_Deposit_ is closed. This ensures that DoS attacks based on repeatedly creating
signing groups have high economic cost.

Beneficary status is transferable (in Ethereum this is implemented as an
ERC721-compatible non-fungible token). When the _Deposit_ resolves, the
withheld TBTC (or equivalent value) will be returned to the current beneficiary
along with a small additional payment. In this way the beneficiary NFT
functions as a zero-coupon bond issued by the signing group upon funding. If
the signing group performs its obligations, the beneficiary will eventually
receive the bond payout.

Signer fees are described in more detail in
<<../custodial-fees/index#,their own section>>.
