== Overview

tBTC provides a mechanism for creating a token, TBTC, on a non-Bitcoin _host
chain_ (in tBTC v1, this host chain is Ethereum), that is 1-to-1 backed by
bitcoin. Parties interested in minting TBTC <<request,request>> that
the tBTC system provide them with a Bitcoin wallet address. The system
<<signer-selection,selects a set of _signers_>>, which are tasked with
generating a private/public keypair and furnishing it to the system. The
interested party then becomes a _depositor_ by sending bitcoin to the wallet
(the amount of required bitcoin is discussed separately in the section on
<<Lots,lots>>). The deposit cannot be maintained for free, as deposits require
signers to put up an ETH bond to guarantee good behavior (see the section on
<<Deposit economics>>). To cover these costs, the deposit is paid for by
signing fees that cover a set _term_ of deposit redemption exclusivity for
the deposit owner, discussed separately in the section on <<term,terms>>.

Each of these steps is shown in the diagram below and discussed in subsequent
sections.

[[request]]
== Deposit request

The starting point for acquiring TBTC is generating a _deposit request_. This
request is a transaction to a smart contract on tBTC's host chain, which
signals that the sender requires a signing group backed wallet.
Signing groups are not free to create. Therefore deposit requests include a
small bond in the host chain's native token to cover the creation of the
signing group. The bond is refunded when a successful deposit is made to the
generated wallet.

[[signer-selection]]
=== Signer selection

Once the deposit request is received, the signing group is created by randomly
selecting a set of _signers_ to back a Bitcoin wallet. This is a multi-part
process described in the diagram below.footnote:[The tBTC system participates
in fairly limited fashion here, mostly coordinating work done in a secondary
system responsible for managing the secure random number generation, private
data storage, and multiparty computation needed to provide the system's relevant
security properties. In this diagram, that role is fulfilled by the Keep
network, described in http://keep.network/whitepaper[its whitepaper]. The Keep
Random Beacon is described in more detail in the
http://docs.keep.network/random-beacon/[Keep Random Beacon yellowpaper].]

When a request comes in to create a signing group, the tBTC system requests a
random seed from a secure decentralized random beacon.footnote:[A system is only
as decentralized as its most centralized component, so the beacon must be
decentralized to achieve proper decentralization of the tBTC system as a whole.]
The resulting random seed is used to randomly select signing group members from
the eligible pool of signers. Finally, these signers coordinate a distributed
key generation protocol that results in a public ECDSA key for the group, which
is used to produce a wallet address that is then published to the host chain.
This completes the signer selection phase.

==== Signer bonding

Before the selected members of a signing group can perform distributed key
generation, they must agree to become members of the signing group by putting up
a bond (the _signer bond_) in the native token of the host chain.
This bond is used to penalize:

- members of the signing group if an unauthorized piece of data is signed by
  the signing group after distributed key generation is complete
- a member if they cause the distributed key generation to fail and failure can
  be attributed to them misbehavior of that member
- the signing group if it fails to produce a signature for the system when
  requested

And additionally to bring the system into balance in cases of
undercollateralization.

Bonding is described in more detail in
<<bonding/index#bonding,its own section>>.

==== Distributed key generation

:threshold-signature: footnote:[Threshold signatures allow a group of N \
signers to generate a public key and a set of private key shares, with which \
a subset M of the signers can create signatures on behalf of the group. For \
tBTC v1, signing groups are 3-of-3, meaning they are groups of 3 signers that \
require all 3 signers to collaborate to create signatures on behalf of the \
group.]
Some small notes about the distributed key generation a signing group undergoes.
The distributed key generation protocol should have three properties:

1. The signing group as a whole should have an _ECDSA public key_, which will be
   shared on the host chain and will correspond to the Bitcoin wallet
   owned by that signing group.
2. Each member of the signing group should have a _threshold ECDSA secret key
   share_{threshold-signature}, which can be used to create a
   _threshold ECDSA signature share_ for any transactions involving the
   signing group's wallet.
3. Each member of the signing group should be able to combine a threshold number
   of signature shares from itself and other members of the group to produce a
   signed version of a given transaction to be performed on behalf of the
   signing group.

[[funding]]
== Making a deposit

:sufficient-confirmations: footnote:[For tBTC v1, sufficient confirmations means 6 confirmations. Confirmation numbers \
that are variable, particularly in response to volume of deposits that are \
opened, are part of the discussion for tBTC v2.]

Once the tBTC system has a wallet address available for a given deposit request,
the _depositor_ can broadcast a Bitcoin transaction sending BTC from a wallet
they control to the wallet address for the signing group. Once the transaction
has been sufficiently confirmed{sufficient-confirmations} by the Bitcoin
chain, the depositor has to issue a transaction to the host chain proving
that the _Deposit_ has been funded.

The only link between the Bitcoin chain and the host chain is the tBTC system,
which runs as a set of smart contracts on the host chain. As such, the Bitcoin
transaction issued by the depositor has to be proven to the tBTC system before
the tBTC system allows the depositor to behave as if they have successfully
deposited their BTC into the signer wallet. When a deposit proof is accepted
by the system, the deposit bond is refunded to the depositor. If a deposit
proof is not received within a given timeout window, the signing group will
disband and the system will seize the bond's value, making it available to the
signing group members to reclaim.

=== Light Relays

To prove a deposit, the depositor submits proof that the transaction was
included in a valid Bitcoin block with sufficient work. The proof is verified
by an on-chain simple payment verification (SPV) contract on the host
chain. A more complete overview of cross-chain SPV systems and their security
properties <<appendix/spv/index#spv,is included in the appendix>>.

Light relays are a new variant of on-chain SPV developed for tBTC. They seek to
take advantage of the compact and efficient stateless SPV proofs while relaying
enough information to provide each stateless proof with some recency guarantee.
We achieve this by taking advantage of the difficulty adjustment feature of
Bitcoin's protocol. Bitcoin adjusts difficulty every 2016 blocks, based on
timestamps of the first and last block in that period (due to an off-by-one
error in the Satoshi client, one interblock period is excluded from the
difficulty calculation). The change is deterministic and within some tolerance
may be set by the miner of the last block.

A light relay does not store every block header. Instead it stores only a slice
of headers around the difficulty adjustment event and records the difficulty
for the current 2016-block epoch. This slice is validated by its objective
proof of work, as well as verifying that its first headers' difficulty matches
the current epoch difficulty, that the change occurs at an expected index in
the slice, and that the new difficulty conforms to Bitcoin's adjustment
algorithm. In other words, our light relay tracks only Bitcoin's current
difficulty, and no other information about its state.

Knowing the current difficulty gives stateless SPV proofs stronger recency
assurances. Any newly-generated stateless SPV must include that difficulty in
its header chain. And that difficulty is not known to any party in advance.
Miners with an `n`-fraction (as usual, `n >= 2` due to the 51% assumption) of
the hashrate have a `1/n` chance of being allowed to set the difficulty, and
thus have a `1/n` chance of being able to successfully predict it 2 weeks in
advance (by generating fake proofs, and then setting the difficulty such that
they appear valid). Generalized, this is a `1/n^t^` chance of successfully
predicting difficulty `t` adjustment periods (`2t` weeks) in advance. Therefore
the use of the light relay provides stronger security properties to stateless
SPV proofs when used as an additional validation step, as even entities with
significant mining resources have a greatly reduced chance of creating fake
proofs.

== Lots

Deposits will be managed in fixed-size _lots_. Therefore, each deposit will
have to be of the same amount: {btc-lot-size}. Thus, a depositor submitting
their <<Proof of deposit,proof of deposit>> must prove that they deposited
{btc-lot-size} into the deposit's signing group wallet. If a depositor wants to
deposit more than the lot size, they will need to create multiple deposit
requests and fund multiple deposits. This allows each deposit to be backed by
a different signing group, both simplifying the bonding of signing groups and
improving the resilience of the system to signing group failure, malicious or not.
