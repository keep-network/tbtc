= Redemption Flow

ifndef::tbtc[toc::[]]


== Overview

// TODO: Link flow state names and transition names from elsewhere in
// documentation to here

This is the process to redeem a deposit. Once started, redemption cannot be
cancelled, except by proving signer fraud. Cancellation is impossible because
as soon as redemption is requested the signers are permitted to sign, and a
signature (even one neither chain knows about) can't be revoked.

Ergo, cancellation of this process could result in BTC moved from the signers'
address, and an Active Deposit with TBTC outstanding. This would result in a
broken supply peg.

The requester notifies the `Deposit` of the bitcoin tx information (fee and
recipient pubkeyhash) they are requesting, along with enough TBTC to cover the
outstanding TBTC from the `Deposit`, plus enough to cover signer fees and the
funder bond payment.

== States

=== `AWAITING_WITHDRAWAL_SIGNATURE`
* A redemption has been initiated
* The signers MUST sign a digest
* The signers may return the signature for verification
* *NOTE*: there is a disincentive to return a signature, as the caller must
	pay for ecrecover gas and storage slot updates (to transition states).

=== `AWAITING_WITHDRAWAL_PROOF`
* The signers has returned a valid signature on the message
* The signers MUST provide a settlement proof
* In happy cases, we may skip the this state entirely.

=== Flow reachable from
* `ACTIVE`
** via `requestWithdrawal`

=== Reachable exterior states
* `LIQUIDATION_IN_PROGRESS`
** via an ECDSA or BTC fraud proof
** via a state timeout
* `REDEEMED`
** By providing a valid proof showing payment to the requester

== Internal Transitions
=== `provideWithdrawalSignature`
* signers provide a valid ECDSA signature under their pubkey
* *access control*
** Anyone
** expected: 1 or more signers
* *args*
** `uint8 _v`
** `bytes32 _r`
** `bytes32 _s`
*** The redemption signature

** `bytes32 signingGroupPubkeyX;`
*** The X coordinate of the signing group's pubkey
** `bytes32 signingGroupPubkeyY;`

** `bytes32 lastRequestedDigest`
*** Only accept signatures on the _most recent_ requested digest
* *from*
** `AWAITING_WITHDRAWAL_SIGNATURE`
* *to*
** `AWAITING_WITHDRAWAL_PROOF`

=== `increaseWithdrawalFee`
* Explicitly allow a new signature with an increased fee. The fee may increased
  in linear steps over time. The new fee must be explicitly authorized by the
  contract, and the authorizing tx confirmed, before a new signature is
  created. To prevent bad behavior, signers must provide a signature at each
  fee level well before the next increase is available.
