= Frauds & Aborts

ifndef::tbtc[toc::[]]


== Overview

Fraud and abort  processes handle custody failures. This includes punishing
signers and starting the bond liquidation process. These transitions can be
invoked from almost any _Deposit_ state, as faults may occur during any other
flow. Once fault has been proven, the bonds are put up for auction to the
public via the <<Liquidation>> flow.

While there is no fraud or abort state per se, it seems helpful to put the
fraud-related state transitions in a single document.

== States

=== `COURTESY_CALL`
* The signers have been courtesy called
* They SHOULD request redemption of the deposit
* Anyone may request redemption

=== `LIQUIDATION_IN_PROGRESS`
* Liquidation due to undercollateralization or an abort has started
* Automatic (on-chain) liquidation was unsuccessful

=== `FRAUD_LIQUIDATION_IN_PROGRESS`
* Liquidation due to fraud has started
* Automatic (on-chain) liquidation was unsuccessful

=== `LIQUIDATED`
* End state
* The bonds have been liquidated and the position has been closed out

=== Flow reachable from
* `ACTIVE`
* `AWAITING_WITHDRAWAL_SIGNATURE`
* `AWAITING_WITHDRAWAL_PROOF`
* `SIGNER_MARGIN_CALLED`
