== Overview

// TODO: ref bip143

For signing, Bitcoin transforms transactions using a process known as the
SignatureHash (sighash) algorithm. The original sighash algorithm had many
drawbacks and sharp edges. In SegWit scripts, the algorithm was changed to
follow BIP143 (legacy addresses still use the original algorithm).

The goal of the sighash algorithm is to commit to selected aspects of the
transaction in the signed digest. This prevents malleation, and indicates the
signer's intent with respect to them. Specifically, BIP143 sighash commits to
the following (not in this order):

1. One or All inputs
1. None, One, or All outputs
1. The specific prevout this signature witnesses
1. The pubkey script or redeem script code locking that prevout
1. The value of the prevout this signature witnesses
1. The sequence of the input spending that prevout
1. The transaction version
1. The transaction locktime

These are committed to via the double-sha256 of an ordered bytestring. This
digest is signed, and can be reproduced by anyone inspecting the transaction
(provided they have access to historical chain data to validate the prevout
value). Sighash calculation is thus a crucial part of the Bitcoin consensus
process.

Because a signing group may withhold signatures, the redemption flow forces
them to provide a valid signature within a certain timeout. This implies that
the redemption flow must be able to evaluate "validity" means in this context.
Because the goal is redemption, a "valid" signature is one that witnesses a
transaction that sends funds to the public key hash requested at the beginning
of the redemption flow. In order to check that a given signature witnesses such
a transaction, we need to enable our contracts to validate the sighash digest
signed.

By far the easiest way to do this is to create a canonical transaction. We can
then implement a greatly-reduced set of BIP143's functionality while still
being able to assess signature validity during redemption. This allows us to,
instead of calculating the sighash of an input transaction, specify a sighash,
and force construction of a transaction that matches it. This way the contract
can request extremely precise redemption transactions with minimal overhead.

== Canonical Redemption Sighash

BIP143 follows this general format:
```
Double SHA256 of the serialization of:
   1. nVersion of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
   2. hashPrevouts (32-byte hash)
   3. hashSequence (32-byte hash)
   4. outpoint (32-byte hash + 4-byte little endian)
   5. scriptCode of the input (serialized as scripts inside CTxOuts)
   6. value of the output spent by this input (8-byte little endian)
   7. nSequence of the input (4-byte little endian)
   8. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
   9. nLocktime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
  10. sighash type of the signature (4-byte little endian)
```

// TODO: ref my blogpost on sighash types

Because we don't need to use timelocks in our redemption transaction, we forbid
their usage, allowing us to immediately standardize many elements. We also
forbid use of any sighash flag, other than `SIGHASH_ALL`, so we can standardize
that as well. Here we replace those elements with the standardized hex strings:

```
Double SHA256 of the serialization of:
   1. 01000000
   2. hashPrevouts (32-byte hash)
   3. hashSequence (32-byte hash)
   4. outpoint (32-byte hash + 4-byte little endian)
   5. scriptCode of the input (serialized as scripts inside CTxOuts)
   6. value of the output spent by this input (8-byte little endian)
   7. 00000000
   8. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
   9. 00000000
  10. 01000000
```

Forbidding the transaction to have more than 1 input or output gives us one
additional victory. Point 3, `hashSequence` is defined as "the double SHA256 of
the serialization of nSequence of all inputs." By having 1 input and disabling
its timelock feature we can standardize this as well:

```
Double SHA256 of the serialization of:
   1. 01000000
   2. hashPrevouts (32-byte hash)
   3. 8cb9012517c817fead650287d61bdd9c68803b6bf9c64133dcab3e65b5a50cb9
   4. outpoint (32-byte hash + 4-byte little endian)
   5. scriptCode of the input (serialized as scripts inside CTxOuts)
   6. value of the output spent by this input (8-byte little endian)
   7. 00000000
   8. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
   9. 00000000
  10. 01000000
```

Next, we fill in information that the contract has access to, starting with
the details of its custodied UTXO. The Deposit contract has validated the SPV
funding proof, and stored its value as well as its outpoint. BIP143 specifies
`hashPrevouts` as "the double SHA256 of the serialization of all input
outpoints" So we can populate steps 2, 4, and 6 using known information:

```
bytes8 depositSizeBytes
bytes utxoOutpoint

Double SHA256 of the serialization of:
   1. 01000000
   2. {hash256(utxoOutpoint)}
   3. 8cb9012517c817fead650287d61bdd9c68803b6bf9c64133dcab3e65b5a50cb9
   4. {utxoOutpoint}
   5. scriptCode of the input (serialized as scripts inside CTxOuts)
   6. {depositSizeBytes}
   7. 00000000
   8. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
   9. 00000000
  10. 01000000
```

The scriptCode is also available to the contract, as it is derived from the
signers' threshold public key hash. According to BIP143, "For P2WPKH witness
program, the `scriptCode` is `0x1976a914{20-byte-pubkey-hash}88ac`."

```
bytes8 depositSizeBytes
bytes utxoOutpoint
bytes20 signerPKH

Double SHA256 of the serialization of:
   1. 01000000
   2. {hash256(utxoOutpoint)}
   3. 8cb9012517c817fead650287d61bdd9c68803b6bf9c64133dcab3e65b5a50cb9
   4. {utxoOutpoint}
   5.
       1. 1976a914
       2. {signerPKH}
       3. 88ac
   6. {depositSizeBytes}
   7. 00000000
   8. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
   9. 00000000
  10. 01000000
```

This leaves us with only `hashOutputs` unknown to the contract at redemption
time. Intuitively, this makes sense, as the contract knows where the money is,
but not where it should be sent on redemption. As always, we reference BIP143
which says "hashOutputs is the double SHA256 of the serialization of all output
amount [sic] (8-byte little endian) with scriptPubKey." This can get quite
long with multiple outputs, but as mentioned earlier, we can standardize on
single-output transactions. This means that it's the double-sha256 of the
8-byte LE value being redeemed (less a mining fee), and the pubkey script
containing the redeemer's script hash. In our redemption flow, both of these
things are set by the user at request time. This means the contract has access
to them as function arguments when it requests that the signer group produces
a signature. Therefore the contract can specify a precise digest for that
signature:

```
bytes8 depositSizeBytes
bytes utxoOutpoint
bytes20 signerPKH

Double SHA256 of the serialization of:
   1. 01000000
   2. {hash256(utxoOutpoint)}
   3. 8cb9012517c817fead650287d61bdd9c68803b6bf9c64133dcab3e65b5a50cb9
   4. {utxoOutpoint}
   5.
       1. 1976a914
       2. {signerPKH}
       3. 88ac
   6. {depositSizeBytes}
   7. 00000000
   8.
       1. hash256(
       2. {_outputValueBytes}
       3. {_requesterPKH}
       4. )
   9. 00000000
  10. 01000000
```

It is easy to implement this as a pure function in Solidity:

```
/// @notice                 calculates the sighash of a redemption tx
/// @dev                    documented in bip143. many values are hardcoded
/// @param _outpoint        the bitcoin output script
/// @param _inputPKH        the input pubkeyhash (hash160(sender_pubkey))
/// @param _inputValue      the value of the input in satoshi
/// @param _outputValue     the value of the output in satoshi
/// @param _outputPKH       the output pubkeyhash (hash160(recipient_pubkey))
/// @return                 the double-sha256 (hash256) signature hash

    );
    return _sighashPreimage.hash256();
}
```
