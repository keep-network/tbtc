Consensus relay:: Chain-tracking SPV on some other chain, e.g. BTCRelay.
Consensus relays are long-running cross-chain mechanisms that track the
consensus state of another chain. They're distinguished from other uses of the
term "relay", eg the "threshold relay" random beacon mechanism.

SPV:: Simplified payment verification

Stateless SPV:: Non-chain-tracking SPV
