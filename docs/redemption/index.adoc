== Overview

Deposits represents real Bitcoin unspent transaction outputs ("UTXOs") and are
redeemable for the BTC held there. The tBTC redemption system aims to provide
access to those BTC via a publicly-verifiable process. To support this goal,
the redemption flow has been designed such that any actor may perform its
critical actions (with the exception of producing signatures).

So long as the deposit is maintained in good standing, anyone may
<<Redemption Requests,request redemption>>. To do so, the requester must repay
outstanding TBTC (plus accrued custodial fees) and provide their Bitcoin
payment details. At this point, the redemption process may not be cancelled.
Once redemption has been requested, the signers must produce a valid Bitcoin
signature sending the underlying BTC to the requested address. After a
signature has been published, any actor may build and submit a
_redemption transaction_ to the Bitcoin blockchain using that signature.

== Redemption Requests

// TODO: fill in real numbers for all of these
:min-redemption-fee: 2345 satoshi
:min-redemption-feerate: ~20 satoshi/vbyte
:minimal-custodial-period: 6 months

If the deposit is in good standing (has not been accused of fraud, or entered
signer liquidation), and {minimal-custodial-period} has elapsed since the
deposit was created, anyone may request redemption. To do so that person makes
a _redemption request_ transaction to the smart contract on the host chain. The
_redemption request_ includes the following:

1. A fee amount
  - must be >={min-redemption-fee} ({min-redemption-feerate})
2. A public key hash (PKH) for BTC delivery
  - the 20-byte hash160 of a public key belonging to the requester
  - for security and privacy, this should be a new keypair
3. _Deposit_ size plus fees (see <<Repayment Amount>>)

Upon receipt of the _redemption request_, the smart contract burns TBTC equal
to the _Deposit_ size, distributes signer fees and the beneficiary bond, and
records the receipt of the request, and notifies the signers that a signature
is required.

Once notified of the redemption request, the signers must wait for confirmation
on the host chain. If they do not wait for confirmation, the redemption request
may be dropped from the chain via a reorg, in which case any signature they
produced could be used to both redeem the BTC and submit a signer fraud proof.
A fraud proof created this way would appear valid to the host chain smart
contract because it no longer has a record of the redemption request.


== Repayment Amount

// TODO
:custodial-fee: 0.005 TBTC (50 basis points)
:beneficiary-bond-payment: 0.0005 TBTC

The repayment amount is the _Deposit_ size plus the custodial fee of
{custodial-fee} and a payment of {beneficiary-bond-payment} to the deposit
beneficiary. This ensures that the signers are paid upon providing a signature
and that the beneficiary is compensated for opening the deposit.


== Redemption Transaction Format

A redemption transaction has a perfectly canonical format which is embedded
in the smart contracts running on the tBTC host chain. This prevents a number
of complex attacks on the tBTC supply peg, as well as simplifying contract
logic. The requester may specify only 2 aspects of the transaction: its fee and
its destination. All other deposit-specific information (e.g. the outpoint and
the UTXO size) is known to the deposit contract in advance.

// TODO: Link

The _redemption transaction_ has 1 input (the deposit UTXO) and 1 output (the
redemption output). It does not have change outputs, or additional inputs, as
none are needed. It simply transfers the underlying BTC to the sole custody of
the requester. Its timelock and sequence numbers are set to 0 and its version
is set to 1. Full documentation of the format and the construction of its
sighash can be found in the appendix

Because the format is simple and canonical, any observer may use publicly
available information to build it. Once a signature has been published, it is
simple to add a witness to the transaction and broadcast it. So while signers
have a strong incentive to broadcast the transaction as early as possible,
anyone may do so if the signers do not.


== Redemption Proof

:redemption-proof-timeout: 12 hours

// TODO: Link SPV proof breakdown

A _redemption proof_ is an SPV proof that a _redemption transaction_ was
confirmed by the Bitcoin blockchain. Once a request to redeem is confirmed, the
deposit smart contract expects a _redemption proof_ within
{:redemption-proof-timeout}. To validate a _redemption proof_, the smart
contract performs normal SPV proof verification, and additionally verifies that
the recipient matches the requester's pulic key hash, and the value is greater
than or equal `UTXO Size - highest allowed fee` (see
<<Allowing for Bitcoin Fee Adjustment>> for more details).


== Validating a Signature

:signature-timeout: 3 hours

After the redemption request is sufficiently confirmed, the signers MUST
produce a signature on the _redemption transaction_ signature hash as
requested. They have {signature-timeout} in which to produce either a
signature, or a <<Redemption Proof, _redemption proof_>> before being subject
to penalties. Upon submission of a valid signature a _redemption proof_ is
still required, but the deadline is extended to {redemption-proof-timeout} in
total.

As discussed <<Redemption Transaction Format, earlier>>, the host chain smart
contract managing the deposit has all information necessary to calculate the
_redemption transaction_ signature hash. This includes the signers' threshold
public key. Using the public key, the signature hash, and the redemption
request the smart contract can know both the cryptographic validity of the
signature and that a signature on that digest was requested as part of a
redemption process.


== Allowing for Bitcoin Fee Adjustment

:fee-increase-timer: 4 hours
:fee-increase-timer-times-two:

// TODO: link ECDSA fraud proofs

Because Bitcoin fees are determined by network congestion and other highly
unpredictable factors, the requester may not select an appropriate fee. Signers
are punished if no redemption proof is submitted *or* if they sign
without explicit authorization. This could creates a no-win scenario for
signers, in which they could not get the requester's transaction confirmed in
the current fee climate and would eventually be punished despite honest
behavior. Unfortunately, we cannot rely on the requester to stay online or
update fee rates honestly. Ergo, the system requires some mechanism to fairly
adjust fee rates without the requester's explicit consent.

The simplest scheme is to allow signers to increase the fee without requester
consent after a timeout. As such, we allow signers to increase fees linearly
every {fee-increase-timer}. Which is to say, if the fee is `f`, after
{fee-increase-timer} the signers may notify the deposit contract of a fee
increase to `2f` and if the transaction remains unconfirmed after
{fee-increase-timer-times-two}, the signers may notify the contract of a fee
increase to `3f`. This ensures that a redemption transaction will eventually
be confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain near the minimal fee rate given current
network congestion. To prevent the signers from repeatedly requesting fee
increases, they must actually provide a signature at each fee level. This
ensures that each feerate is actually attempted before an increase is
requested.
