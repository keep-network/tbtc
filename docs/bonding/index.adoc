Because signers are able to collude to censor withdrawals or abscond with funds,
a bond is required per deposit from each backing signer.

Unlike the staked work tokens used to choose signers, signer bonds need to be a
liquid asset with a large market cap. This restriction increases the cost of
market-based attacks, where the price of bonded collateral can be pushed up or
down by market manipulation.

Bonded signers offer depositors recourse in the case of colluding signers
interfering with operation. A signing group that doesn't sign within a timeout
forfeits their bond; a signing group that provably signs unauthorized material
forfeits their bond, and risks their work token stake.

== Acceptable collateral

Two tokens present themselves as obvious choices for signing bond
collateralâ€”TBTC and the underlying work token. During the bootstrap phase of
the network, neither is an appropriate candidate due to low liquidity.

Since signer bonds need to be denominated in a widely traded asset to avoid
market manipulation, the next most obvious pick for bonding is the host chain's
native token. For tBTC v1, that means ETH. As the ecosystem matures, other
bond collateral options might become feasible at the expense of a more
complex implementation.

== Measuring security

Clearly, security concerns require signing bonds that are proportional to the
size of a _Deposit_. To maintain a negative expected value from signers
colluding, the amount forfeited by misbehaving signers must be strictly
greater than the amount they have to gain. Assuming a lot size of {btc-lot-size},
constant exchange rate between BTC and the bonded asset, and a M-of-N group
of signers backing a _Deposit_, the minimum collateral for each signer is
`({btc-lot-size})/M`, denominated in the asset being bonded, ETH in the base
case.

[example]
Consider a 1 BTC _Deposit_ backed by a 3-of-5 group of Signers. In the worse
case, 3 of the signers can be malicious and try to steal the deposit, which
would net them each 1/3 BTC. As a result, all 5 Signers must bond 0.33 BTC
each, denominated in ETH.

NOTE: For tBTC v1, attributability limitations in the signing protocol mean
the signer group is 3-of-3. As a result, the required per-signer bond will be
{extra-collateral} of {btc-lot-size} per signer, for a total
{total-collateral} bond (see the following section on
<<overcollateralization>>). With attributability in later versions, bonds
will be able to be decreased.

== Pricing currency fluctuations

The above assumes a constant exchange rate between BTC and ETH, but in truth
the two currencies fluctuate relative to each other, sometimes wildly.

[[overcollateralization]]
=== ETH price drop relative to BTC

If the value of ETH drops precipitously relative to BTC, then the dollar value
of the ETH bonded by the signers can be less than the dollar value of the BTC
deposit they have backed, meaning they have positive expected value if they try
to steal the BTC.

In order to avoid that, we require that the bonds are overcollateralized. For
each ETH they collateralize, they must put up an additional
{extra-collateral}, for a total of {total-collateral} collateralization rate.

[example]
**Without overcollateralization:** Let 1 BTC be worth $10000, and 1 ETH be
worth $200. Signers have to put up 50 ETH to back a deposit. Due to market
conditions, ETH drops 25% to $150, while BTC maintains its value. The 50 ETH
is worth $7500, meaning the Signers can make a $2500 profit by stealing the
deposit.

[example]
**With overcollateralization:** Let 1 BTC be worth $10,000, and 1 ETH be worth
$200. Signers have to put up 75 ETH (150% of 50) to back a deposit. Due to
market conditions, ETH drops 25% to $150, while BTC maintains its value. The
75 ETH is worth $11250, which is above the dollar value of BTC meaning the
Signers should maintain honest behavior since they have more to lose.

In general, total overcollateralization of {total-collateral} (`3/2 * 100%`)
keeps Signer incentives aligned with the well-being of the system up to a 33%
drop (`(1 - 2/3) * 100%`) in price of the bonded asset against the deposit's
asset. Increasing this percentage can increase the robustness of the system,
at the expense of opportunity cost to the Signers which should be compensated
via fees.

If the value of ETH crosses a security threshold, open _Deposit_ s will enter
<<pre-liquidation, pre-liquidation>>, followed by <<liquidation, liquidation>>.

// TODO insert a little historical analysis for a decent starting number


=== BTC price drop relative to ETH

Since <<signer-fees/index.adoc#signer-fees,signer fees>> are denominated per
BTC in custody (with overcollateralization factored in), a BTC value drop
against the bonded asset translates to lower fees for Signers. Note that this
does not create any issue for TBTC reserves, but it makes the system less
attractive to signers earning fees on their assets.

Signers SHOULD buy TBTC from the markets in anticipation of such overly
overcollateralized Deposits and they SHOULD use it to redeem these positions,
thus reclaiming their ETH liquidity which can be used to back other Deposits. An
alternative would be to provide Signers with the ability to safely rebalance their
bonds back to {total-collateral}, however that introduces implementation
complexities and as a result is not the preferred solution for the initial
deployment of the mechanism.

[example]
Let 1 BTC be worth $10,000, and 1 ETH be worth $200. Signers have to put up 75
ETH to back a deposit. Signers are expected to make a signer fee of 5 basis
points on a $10,000 deposit for $15,000 of collateral (0.05% of $10,000): $5.
Due to market conditions, ETH soars 25% to $250, while BTC maintains its
value. The Signers still get $5 per BTC under custody, however the 75 ETH is
worth $18750 (hence 187.5% overcollateralized), meaning 5 basis points for
its custody would be $9.375. A signer redeems the Deposit by paying 1.0005 TBTC,
reclaiming 1 BTC and unlocking the 75 ETH which was locked by all Signers.
All significantly overcollateralized Signers now have liquid ETH which they
can use to back another deposit to mint new TBTC, now with a lower collateral
requirement in ETH.

== A resilient price feed

Unlike popular synthetic stablecoin schemes, the tBTC system design makes no
effort to stabilize the value of TBTC relative to BTC. TBTC will be priced by
the market. Instead, the goal is to ensure that the TBTC supply is strictly
less than its backing BTC reserves.

For this reason, the only price relationship the system needs to understand is
between the signing bond collateral and BTC.

For tBTC v1, that means the price of ETH relative to BTC. Due to only needing
prices for a single pair of assets, tBTC will initially use a simple
<<price-feed/index.adoc#price-feed,price feed>>.

== Undercollateralization

// TODO explain the undercollateralization curve
[[pre-liquidation]]
=== Pre-liquidation: a courtesy call

At the first threshold of {pre-liquidation-threshold}, a _Deposit_ enters
pre-liquidation. Pre-liquidation indicates that the signers should close the
_Deposit_ or face forced liquidation after a pre-liquidation period. If the
_Deposit_ is not closed within {pre-liquidation-period}, or if the _Deposit_
collateral falls below {liquidation-threshold} collateralization, liquidation will
follow. This gives each signer an incentive to close the position before it
becomes severely undercollateralized. Alternatively, if the ETHBTC ratio
recovers such that the deposit becomes at least {pre-liquidation-threshold}
collateralized during the {pre-liquidation-period}, the _Deposit_ is safe and
is moved away from the pre-liquidation state.

In future versions of the system, more complex pre-liquidation mechanisms
could be introduced. For the initial version it seems prudent to choose a
simple mechanism with large penalties for ongoing undercollateralization. In
addition, by incentivizing redemption of undercollateralized or significantly
overcollateralized positions, Signers are protected from being long ETH for
long periods of time.

[[liquidation]]
=== Liquidation

:fraudulent-signature: footnote:[signatures not explicitly authorized by the \
tBTC system are considered fraudulent. The system only authorizes redemption \
signatures when a redemption is in progress.]

:vm-deposit-owner: footnote:[Note that, for deposits that have been used to back \
TBTC via the vending machine, the deposit owner is the vending machine itself, \
so by making the deposit owner whole, the system ensures the TBTC supply is in \
line with BTC custodied by TBTC-backing deposits.]

Forced liquidation should be rare, as rational signers will redeem deposits
before liquidation becomes necessary. However, the possibility of extreme
punishment via liquidation is necessary to prevent dishonest behavior from
signers. Liquidation may occur because because signers
<<failure/index.adoc#abort, didn't produce a valid signature in
response to a redemption request>>, because the value of the signing
bond dropped below the liquidation threshold, because they did not respond to
the courtesy call, or because the signers <<failure/index.adoc#fraud,
produced a fraudulent signature>>{fraudulent-signature}.

The primary goal of the liquidation process is to make the deposit owner
whole in the face of incorrect signer behavior or external dynamics that
compromise deposit safety.{vm-deposit-owner} The secondary goal is to punish
signers maximally for incorrect behavior, when such behavior can be proven.

The most valuable asset held by the system is the signer bond. Therefore, the
liquidation process seizes the signer bond and attempts to use the bonded
value to purchase and compensate the deposit owner. Any signer bond left over
after the deposit owner is compensated is distributed to the account
responsible for reporting the misbehavior (for fraud) or between the signers and
the account that triggered liquidation (for collateralization issues).

To compensate the deposit owner, the contract starts a falling-price auction
with the seized signer bond. It offers {liquidation-auction-start-percent} of
the signer bond in exchange for the outstanding TBTC amount. The amount of
bond on sale increases over time until someone chooses to purchase it, or the
auction reaches 100% of the bond. The auction will remain open until a buyer
is found.

TBTC received during this process is sent to the deposit owner; if the owner is
the vending machine, the vending machine MUST burn the TBTC to maintain the
supply peg. If any bond value is left after liquidation, one of two things
occurs:

* In case of liquidation due to **undercollateralization or abort**, the
  remaining bond value is split 50-50 between the account which triggered the
  liquidation and the signers.
* In case of liquidation due to **fraud**, the remaining bond value goes
  to the account which triggered the liquidation by proving fraud.

At the end of liquidation, unresponsive or misbehaving signers have control of
the deposited BTC. What those signers do with the BTC outside the tBTC system
is for them to decideâ€”it might be split up, stolen by a signing majority, or
lost permanently.

NOTE: If a Fee Rebate Token (FRT) has been given out to mint TBTC for a
deposit that is liquidated (see <<minting/index.adoc#minting,the Minting
section>>), the FRT owner is _not_ refunded
during liquidation. The fees that were escrowed in exchange for the FRT are
instead used to compensate the signers, and the FRT is no longer eligible for
compensation.

[example]
--
1. Signers guard a deposit of 1 BTC, backed by 75 ETH at 0.02 BTC/ETH (1.5 BTC
in ETH, 150% collateralization ratio).

2. ETH price drops to 0.01333 BTC/ETH. 75 ETH now only collateralizes 100% of
the Deposit (1 BTC / 75 ETH)

3. Liquidation is triggered and the 75 ETH is seized to buy back TBTC.

4. The _Deposit_ must use the 75 ETH to purchase 1 TBTC. In an attempt to get a
discount, it auctions {liquidation-auction-start-percent} of its ETH reserves.

5. An arbitrageur burns 1 TBTC at 90% of the auction and obtains 67.5 ETH. The
liquidation of the _Deposit_ is now over.

6. Half of the remaining 7.5 ETH is distributed to the signers (if they had
committed fraud this would be 0), and the remainder is given to the account
which started the liquidation process on the Ethereum smart contract. At this
point, the _Deposit_ is marked as closed. Note that the FRT holder is not
refunded during liquidation..

7. Optionally, the N signers coordinate and agree on how they will distribute
the 1 BTC deposit.
